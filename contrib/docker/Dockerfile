# Basic Go environment with git, SSL CA certs, and upx.
# The image below is golang:1.18.0-alpine3.15 (linux/amd64)
# It's pulled by the digest (immutable id) to avoid supply-chain attacks.
# Maintainer Note:
#    To update to a new digest, you must first manually pull the new image:
#    `docker pull golang:<new version>`
#    Docker will print the digest of the new image after the pull has finished.
