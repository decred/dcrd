// fastReduce calculates a mapping that is more or less equivalent to x mod N.
// However, instead of using a mod operation that can lead to slowness on many
// processors when not using a power of two due to unnecessary division, this
// uses a "multiply-and-shift" trick that eliminates all divisions as described
// in a blog post by Daniel Lemire, located at the following site at the time
// of this writing:

//
// Since that link might disappear, the general idea is to multiply by N and
// shift right by log2(N).  Since N is a 64-bit integer in this case, it
// becomes:
//
// (x * N) / 2^64 == (x * N) >> 64
//
// This is a fair map since it maps integers in the range [0,2^64) to multiples
// of N in [0, N*2^64) and then divides by 2^64 to map all multiples of N in
// [0,2^64) to 0, all multiples of N in [2^64, 2*2^64) to 1, etc.  This results
// in either ceil(2^64/N) or floor(2^64/N) multiples of N.

	// This uses math/bits to perform the 128-bit multiplication as the compiler
	// will replace it with the relevant intrinsic on most architectures.
	//
	// The high 64 bits in a 128-bit product is the same as shifting the entire
	// product right by 64 bits.
